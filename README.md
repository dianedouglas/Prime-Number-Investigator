## Description:

This is a small Ruby command line program to investigate prime numbers. It was written while we were in school at Epicodus. It was an exercise in practicing Test Driven Development by writing tests to lead us through the problem using RSpec. 

There are two functions we were challenged to write: one will find all the prime numbers up to a given number, and the other will find a quantity of prime numbers (for example, the first 5 primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11.)

## Setup:

1. You need Ruby for this. Here are [the installation instructions](http://railsinstaller.org/en), and [an easy installer for Windows](http://rubyinstaller.org/)
2. You also need rspec to run the included Behavior Driven Development tests. Run this from the command line: `gem install rspec`. If you get permissions errors on a MAc you can run `sudo gem install rspec`. 
3. Clone or download this project and in your command line, change directory into the top level of the project folder. 
4. Run the tests and the program with the command `rspec`. As a demo it will print out all the primes up to the number 15, and then it will also print out the first 15 primes (which go up to the number 47).
